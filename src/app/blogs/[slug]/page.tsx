# CPA Exam Strategy 2025: Proven Methods to Pass

The CPA exam is one of the most challenging professional certifications, with pass rates ranging from 44-62% per section. However, with the right strategy and preparation, you can join the ranks of successful CPAs. Here's your complete roadmap to CPA exam success.

## Understanding the CPA Exam Structure

### Four Sections Overview
1. **AUD (Auditing and Attestation)** - 4 hours
   - Pass Rate: 47-52%
   - Focus: Audit procedures, ethics, reporting
   
2. **BEC (Business Environment and Concepts)** - 4 hours
   - Pass Rate: 56-62% (highest)
   - Focus: Corporate governance, economics, IT
   
3. **FAR (Financial Accounting and Reporting)** - 4 hours
   - Pass Rate: 44-48% (lowest)
   - Focus: GAAP, financial statements, consolidations
   
4. **REG (Regulation)** - 4 hours
   - Pass Rate: 56-60%

- **Written Communication**: BEC section only

## Optimal Section Order Strategy

### Recommended Sequence #1: FAR → AUD → REG → BEC
**Best for**: Students with strong accounting background
- Start with FAR (hardest) while motivation is high

- REG covers tax and business law
- End with BEC (highest pass rate)

### Recommended Sequence #2: BEC → REG → AUD → FAR

- REG has practical applications
- Build to more challenging sections

## Study Timeline and Schedule

- **Months 5-8**: AUD preparation and exam
- **Months 9-12**: REG preparation and exam
- **Months 13-16**: BEC preparation and exam
- **Months 17-18**: Review and retakes if needed

### 12-Month Accelerated Plan
- **3 months per section**
- **20-25 hours per week study time**
- **Higher intensity, less flexibility**

### Study Schedule Template
**Daily Schedule (3-4 hours)**:
- **Hour 1**: Review previous day's material
- **Hour 2**: New material/lectures
- **Hour 3**: Practice MCQs
- **Hour 4**: TBS practice (if time permits)

**Weekly Schedule**:
- **Monday-Friday**: 3-4 hours daily
